## 1. About the project
The goals of this project are:
1. Presentation of the translation of my knowledge in the field of developing backend applications
2. Expanding the knowledge of programming techniques and technologies through experimental

As a result of the above objectives, and as is common in software development, the solutions and design decisions presented in this project do not constitute a scheme that I would consider the only right one - I am aware that some aspects of the presented solution could be solved in a different way. However, based on my experience, I know that the shape of the project is determined by a number of different factors that must be taken into account. For this project, the issue of learning lessons to improve the ability to confront different approaches to software development played an important role.
